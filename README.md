### Installation

#### 📝 Mutual steps. 
---
1. Clone the repo and cd the root folder 📂:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mikebgrep/foodie && cd foodie/foodie_be
```

📝 Skip step 2 if you're not deploying for local use, instead set the env variable in the service secrets vault or add them in the Dockerfile if not available!

2. Rename ```.env.examle``` file to ```.env``` open it and enter values for each variable.
    1. For the ```X_AUTH_HEADER``` you can add random GUUID. (this will be the authentication secret that will be used for authorization to the API).
    2. For ```DJANGO_SECRET``` run the following function in terminal and use the output:
```
$ python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
```

#### Method 1 ( Development)
---
You can install the server locally as following this guide:
1. Install packages
```
# We assume current directory is ../foodie/foodie_be
$ python -m venv ../.venv && source ../.venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.Make the migrations and run the server 
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver
```
---
📝 You can access the admin panel from ```127.0.0.1:8000/admin ``` in browser and ```127.0.0.1:8000/api/foodie``` from Postman or any other client.
Don't forget to add the ```X-Auth-Header``` for each request.

#### Method 2 ( Production- Docker compose )
---
📝 Note for Raspberry pi remove the commented packages 📦 in the Dockerfile.

1. Copy ssl pem files in ``foodie/nginx/ssl`` folder 📂. The file need to be in the folder are ``fullchain.pem`` and ``privkey.pem``.
2. Replace ``localhost`` value in ``foodie/foodie_be/foodie.nginx.conf`` file with the actual domain name of your host.
3. Run docker compose up command in the folder where is it ``docker-compose.yml`` file.
```
$ docker compose up
or
$ docker-compose up
```
At this point the container will be build and running.You can access it from domain name from each browser.

4.Register admin user preferably with curl.
Endpoint: ``POST https://host/api/auth/signup``
Payload:
```
{
    "username": "your-username",
    "password": "your-password",
    "is_superuser": true
}
```

💡 ``X-Auth-Header`` header should be added to request
---
Finally you can access the admin panel from ```https://your-domain-name/admin ``` in browser and ```https://your-domain-name/api/foodie``` from Postman or any other client.

💡 Don't forget to add the ```X-Auth-Header``` for each request.
